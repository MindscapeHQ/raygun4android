- v4.0.0-beta2: This is a major release and has a variety of breaking changes, depending on your use cases. This is an overview of the most important and visible changes:

  - The Maven groupID for loading RG4A has changed to com.raygun.
  - The build process now uses Gradle, the Maven build process has been removed without replacement.

    - app module build sample app
    - provider module is an Android Library project and creates .aar artifacts
  - Various improvements to sample app
  - The background services are now a JobIntentService to better deal with background limitations in Android 8+. This will behave as a Service on Android 7 and earlier devices.
  - Sending POST data to the Raygun backend has been refactored to using Okhttp3. RG4A therefore has a new implementation dependency on this library.
  - Build requirements have been updated to compileSDK 28 and minSDK 16+.

  - Changes to RUM and Pulse APIs
